## Understanding How Matplotlib Represents Event Data
In Matplotlib, `event.xdata` (and similar attributes like `event.ydata`) represents the data coordinates of a mouse click or interaction, and these are returned in the format that corresponds to the data type of the plot's axes.

If `event.xdata` contains data in a "Matplotlib format," it's typically referring to the following concepts:

### 1. **Data Representation for Different Axis Types**
Matplotlib plots can use different kinds of data for the x-axis (and y-axis) based on the type of plot and data used:
- **Numerical data**: If your x-axis is numerical, `event.xdata` will return the x-value in its numerical form (like a float).
- **Datetime objects**: If your x-axis is based on `datetime` or `pandas.Timestamp` objects, `event.xdata` will return the corresponding numerical representation (often in days, seconds, or some other time unit).
- **Categorical data**: If the x-axis uses categorical data (such as strings or labels), `event.xdata` will return the index of the category that was clicked.

### 2. **The Format for `event.xdata`**
The format of `event.xdata` corresponds to the axis type used by the plot. Hereâ€™s how it works:

#### 2.1 **Numerical Axes (e.g., Float or Integer Data)**
If the x-axis represents numerical values, `event.xdata` will directly give you the corresponding float or integer value that was clicked.

#### 2.2 **Datetime Axes**
If the x-axis uses dates or times, Matplotlib internally stores and handles dates as a numerical representation, typically a floating-point number representing the number of days since the Unix epoch (1970-01-01 00:00:00) or a similar reference time.

For instance:
- If your x-axis represents timestamps or dates (like `pd.Timestamp` or `datetime`), `event.xdata` will give you a floating-point number representing the number of days (or seconds, depending on the plot) since the epoch. 
- When you click on the plot, `event.xdata` may look like a large float number (such as `20096.66871327352`), which corresponds to the date and time of the click.

#### 2.3 **Categorical Axes**
If the x-axis uses categorical data (strings or labels), Matplotlib will map these categories to indices (i.e., numeric representations). For example:
- If you have categories like `['A', 'B', 'C']`, clicking on "B" might return the value `1`, as it's the index of "B" in the list.
- This is why `event.xdata` can sometimes return integer values corresponding to the category index, rather than the raw category label.

### 3. **Why It Might Appear in "Matplotlib Format"**
When you see "Matplotlib format," it generally means that the data has been transformed into a format that Matplotlib can plot efficiently. This could mean:
- **Dates are represented as floats**: Dates and times are internally represented as floats or integers (e.g., days since epoch, seconds since epoch) to allow for efficient plotting and scaling.
- **Data is transformed for scaling or normalization**: If your data is normalized or scaled (e.g., `event.xdata` represents a percentage of the total range), it might appear as a scaled value.
- **Categorical data is indexed**: Categorical data might appear as indices instead of raw labels.

### Example: `event.xdata` with Datetime Plot

Consider the following example:

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import pandas as pd

# Create a simple time series
dates = pd.date_range('2025-01-01', periods=5, freq='D')
values = [1, 3, 5, 7, 9]

fig, ax = plt.subplots()
ax.plot(dates, values)

# Event handling function
def on_click(event):
    print(f"Clicked x-data: {event.xdata}")

# Connect the event handler
fig.canvas.mpl_connect('button_press_event', on_click)

plt.show()
```

In this example:
- The x-axis represents dates (`datetime` objects).
- When you click on the plot, `event.xdata` will give you a float representing the number of days since the Unix epoch.

If you print `event.xdata`, you might see something like this:

```
Clicked x-data: 20096.66871327352
```

This value (`20096.66871327352`) represents the date of the click as a floating-point number, corresponding to the number of days since `1970-01-01 00:00:00`. Matplotlib uses this internal float representation for dates for efficiency in plotting and computations.

### 4. **Converting Back to Original Format**
If you want to convert the `event.xdata` value (e.g., a float) back to a human-readable timestamp or datetime, you can do the following:

```python
# Convert the float (days since epoch) back to a datetime
clicked_timestamp = pd.to_datetime(event.xdata, unit='D', origin='unix')
print(clicked_timestamp)
```

This converts the float value back into a `pandas.Timestamp` or Python `datetime`.

### Conclusion
`event.xdata` contains data in a "Matplotlib format" because Matplotlib internally handles the data in a numerical form that is optimized for plotting. For date/time plots, this often means that dates are represented as floating-point numbers (e.g., days or seconds since the Unix epoch). The format you see in `event.xdata` depends on the type of data used in your plot's x-axis (numerical, datetime, or categorical).
